### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics in the lab helped me tremendously for the project. I felt prepared to take on this assignment. I was a bit uncomfortable using api, but after working on this project really hard I finally caught the hang of it.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have added more of a personal touch to the project. I would have also added some other cool features that I saw from other websites. Additionally, I would have added the embedded youtube videos.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I enjoyed the whole process of seeing the website become responsive. I spent most of my time working on the javascript file. If I could go back, I would have a better understanding and spend less time coding javascript. After understanding how everything works, my website could have used more css features and interactivity like my peers.
